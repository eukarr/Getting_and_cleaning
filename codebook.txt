The created dataset contains the parameters of the signals (either mean or standard deviation) averaged over the groups corresponding to each person under test and the type of its activity.

The variables in the dataset are as follows.

"subject" is the ID of the person under test, from the original data.
"activity" is the type of the activity corresponding to the measured signal.
"signal" identifies the type of the signal recorded during the test (see below).
"statistics" is the type of the parameter reported for each signal in the provided dataset (according to the task, mean and standard deviation were selected).
"value" is the corresponding signal statistics averaged across the subjects and acticity types. 


The signals in the dataset were taken from the original provided dataset, with the following explanation.  

The features come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
